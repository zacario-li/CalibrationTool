    """Light Transport Matrix

    The Light Transport Matrix expresses the relationship 
    between the light source (e.g., projector) and the camera in linear form.
    It can represent as follows:
      c = Tp
    The column vector `p` is the projected pattern (pq, 1).
    The column vector `c` is the image captured by the camera (mn, 1).
    The matrix `T` is the light transport matrix (mn, pq).

    The light transport matrix is used for relighting[1] and dual-photography[2].

    The brute-force is the simplest method to acquire the light transport matrix, 
    capturing images by illuminating the light sources one by one in sequence. 
    The brute-force method is susceptible to sensor noise.

    This `LightTransport` class uses multiplexed illumination [3] to acquire the light transport matrix. 
    Multiple sources are illuminated in a single capture in the measurement, 
    and the matrix is estimated after capturing images.

    However, as you may have noticed, this method is highly time-consuming for capturing. 
    An efficient way to acquire the light transport matrix has been proposed [2][4][5]. 
    This `LightTransport` class does NOT support these efficient methods, but consider them if you want.
